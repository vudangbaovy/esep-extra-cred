# ESEP: Data Processing and Storage

<h2>Running Instructions</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The program's driver is <code>main.cpp</code>.</li>
  <li> Compile main with <code>g++ -o main main.cpp</code> and run with <code>./main</code></li>
  <li> If running in CLion, <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> is already configured for the environment. Just hit run.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assignment Suggestions</h2>
To improve this assignment, I would clarify how the program is going to be tested and graded. I implemented <code>main.cpp</code> according to Fig 2 in the assignment instructions, but it's unclear whether that's what the grader would be doing to test my functionality. I did thoroughly enjoyed working on this assignment, so I look forward to it becoming an official assignment in the future!
