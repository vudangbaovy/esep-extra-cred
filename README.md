# ESEP: Data Processing and Storage

<h2>Running Instructions</h2>
* The program's driver is `main.cpp`.
* Compile main with `g++ -o main main.cpp` and run with `./main`
* If running in CLion, `CMakeLists.txt` is already configured for the environment. Just hit run.

<h2>Assignment Suggestions</h2>
To improve this assignment, I would clarify how the program is going to be tested and graded. I implemented `main.cpp` according to Fig 2 in the assignment instructions, but it's unclear whether that's what the grader would be doing to test my functionality. I did thoroughly enjoyed working on this assignment, so I look forward to it becoming an official assignment in the future!
